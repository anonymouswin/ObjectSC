#6. Compile on Linux(X86_64)
	$ make

#7. Execute
	$./decBallot
	$./forkBallot

#8. Input
	<inp-output/inp-params.txt>
	<content should be a single line with space separated 4 values as follows:>
	40 400 4 400 .2	
		Where:
		1. l: # of Proposals (SObj)
		2. m: # of Voters (SObj) 
		3. n: # of threads
		4. K: # of Total AUs/Transactions
		5. Î»: Random delay seed

#9. Output
	The terminal output gives time taken by the concurrent miner and validator algorithm.
	
	NOTE:: Output will be from the last algorithm executed.
	1.<inp-output/AtomicUnits.txt> :::: AtomicUnits consists Atomic Units generated by Algorithm, AUs are executed on smart contract by miner and validator.
	2.<inp-output/Output_Time.txt> :::: Output_Time is avg time taken by an AU, the miner, and the validator algorithm in microseconds.
