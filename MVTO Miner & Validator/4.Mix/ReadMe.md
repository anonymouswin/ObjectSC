#6. Compile on Linux(X86_64)
	$ make

#7. Execute
	$./decMix
	$./forkMix

#8. Input
	<inp-output/inp-params.txt>
	<content should be four lines with space separated values as follows:>
	50 400
	10
	3 20
	20 3
		Where:
		1. l = 50 : # of threads
		2. m = 400: # of AUs or Transactions
		3. n = 10 : # of Coin:Account Shared Objects
		4. o = 3  : # of Ballot:Proposal Shared Objects
		5. p = 20 : # of Ballot:Voter Shared Objects
		6. q = 20 : # of Auction:Bidder Shared Objects
		7. r = 3  : Auction: Bid End Time or duration (milliseconds)

#9. Output
	The terminal output gives time taken by the concurrent miner and validator algorithm.
	
	NOTE:: Output will be from the last algorithm executed.
	1.<inp-output/AtomicUnits.txt> :::: AtomicUnits consists Atomic Units generated by Algorithm, AUs are executed on smart contract by miner and validator.
	2.<inp-output/Time.txt> :::: Output_Time is avg time taken by an AU, the miner, and the validator algorithm in microseconds.
